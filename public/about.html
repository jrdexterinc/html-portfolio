<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I'm a Certified Management Accountant with over 30 years of experience working
  alongside leaders as they navigate growth, constraint, and complexity. My
  background spans fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, faith-based organizations,
  and small businesses. These are all environments where financial decisions are
  not theoretical and margin, timing, and stewardship matter.
</p>

<p>
  Over time, I have learned that most financial stress shows up after leadership
  decisions have already been made. Cash flow pressure, uneven results, and
  budget surprises are usually signals of deeper system and clarity gaps, not a
  lack of effort or commitment. I have spent much of my career helping leaders
  connect financial information to real-world decisions, so the numbers become a
  guide instead of a post-mortem.
</p>

<p>
  My work sits at the intersection of finance, operations, and technology. I
  enjoy designing practical frameworks, budgets that actually influence
  behavior, dashboards that tell a story, and processes that bring discipline
  without creating friction. I am especially interested in helping leaders think
  through trade-offs, risk, and sustainability as organizations scale or shift
  direction.
</p>

<p>
  I believe strong financial leadership should create calm, not confusion. When
  leaders have clarity around their financial reality, they gain the confidence
  to focus on what matters most: people, purpose, and long-term impact.
